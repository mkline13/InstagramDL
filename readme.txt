A Google Chrome extension for downloading single images from Instagram's desktop site. Currently only works for images-- no videos.


USAGE:

1. Browse through your photo stream and find an image worth downloading :)
2. Click on the post thumbnail so it expands into the view with the higher-res image and the comments on the side.
3. Right click on the expanded image and choose "Instagram DL" from the context menu.
